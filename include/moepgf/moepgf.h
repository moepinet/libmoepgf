 * Multiplies region r2 by constant and adds the result to region r1. The result
 * is stored in region r1. Length len specifies the length of the regions.
 *
 * void mulrc(uint8_t * r, uint8_t constant, size_t len)

 *
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If len is not a multiple of MOEPGF_MAX_ALIGNMENT, SIMD
 * implementations may silently access memory addresses up to the next multiple
 * of MOEPGF_MAX_ALIGNMENT. The rational behind this behavior is to allow for
 * 1) easy usage since len may be the true length of data to be multiplied
 *    instead of the length of a zero-padded memory region, and
 * 2) efficient processing since no special treatment of the border cases are
 *    needed in the arithmetic kernels.
 *
 * All you have to obey is that one of the following conditions is met:
 * 1) Regions r1 and r2 must be aligned to MOEPGF_MAX_ALIGNMENT and the
 *    allocated memory regions must be a multiple of MOEPGF_MAX_ALIGNMENT.
 * 2) len must be a multiple of MOEPGF_MAX_ALIGNMENT.
